# La Papeinliga

Team organizer for a friendly soccer group. Select attending players from the roster, configure the number of teams, and randomly sort players into balanced teams.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## How It Works

1. **Select players** — check who's attending from the full roster
2. **Configure teams** — choose how many teams to create
3. **Sort teams** — randomly distribute players into teams, re-sort as needed

## Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Tailwind CSS v4
